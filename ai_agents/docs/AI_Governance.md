# Eulers-Shield Autonomous AI Governance

## Overview
This module enables fully autonomous, AI-augmented DAO governance using Solidity smart contracts and off-chain LLM-powered agents.

## Structure
- **contracts/EulersShieldDAO.sol**: DAO smart contract for proposals, voting, and AI analysis.
- **ai_agents/ai_governance_agent.py**: Off-chain agent that analyzes proposals and posts summaries on-chain.
- **ai_agents/dao_abi.json**: ABI for contract interaction.
- **ai_agents/.env**: Environment variables for blockchain and AI access.
- **ai_agents/requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.

## Setup

1. Deploy the smart contract (`EulersShieldDAO.sol`) on your chosen EVM chain.
2. Install Python dependencies:
```
cd ai_agents
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Fill out `.env` with your credentials and contract address.
4. Run the AI agent:
```
python ai_governance_agent.py
```
## Security Notes
- Keep your private keys and API secrets safe!
- For production, use secure key management and rotate credentials regularly.

## Extending the System
- Add more AI models or rules in `ai_governance_agent.py`.
- Integrate with a frontend for user proposals and voting.
- Automate proposal execution logic in the contract.
