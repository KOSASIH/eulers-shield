# Security Considerations for Eulers Shield

Eulers Shield is designed with security in mind. Here are some key considerations:

## Cryptographic Algorithms

- **AES-256 Encryption:** Utilizes the Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key for strong encryption.
- **Secure Key Generation:** Keys are generated using a secure random number generator to ensure unpredictability.

## Key Management Practices

- **Key Storage:** Keys should be stored securely, preferably in an encrypted format.
- **Access Control:** Limit access to keys to authorized users only.

## Password Management

- **Password Strength:** Encourage users to create strong passwords (at least 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).
- **Password Storage:** Store passwords using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).

## Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

- **Regular Updates:** Keep the software updated to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **User  Education:** Educate users on best practices for security and data protection.
